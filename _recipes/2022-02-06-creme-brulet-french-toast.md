tags: dessert, breakfast, french toast, creme brulet

ingredients:
- Custard
- 10 eggs
- 4 egg yolk
- 4 cups whole milk
- 1 cup heavy whipping cream
- 2 vanilla beans (Optional)
- 2 Teaspoons vanilla extract
- 4 Tablespoons Dark Rum (Optional)
- 1/4 teaspoon Salt
- 1/2 teaspoon Fresh grated Nutmeg
- Filling
- 1 stick melted butter
- 1 cup brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon Pure maple syrup (Optional)
- Bread
- 8 slices Brioche Bread (slightly dried in oven or left out overnight)

directions:
- Garnish with fresh strawberries & Kiwi prepped as shown at the 22:00 min mark of the vid (Thank you Mohr!)
- Cook on a flat iron heated to between 350 / 400, ~5 min per side, covered. (Looking for a nice browning on the outside)
- (There’s mention of an oven during the vid, we found it’s better to go right onto the flat iron, no oven needed for final bake)
- Make sure it’s cooked fully on each side before flipping
- You’ll want a large spatula as the "Sandwich" will be fragile until it is heated.
