tags: chocolate, raspberry, cake

ingredients:
- (this is extremely rich cake, so you can easily get 12 to 16 servings) 18 ounces semi-sweet chocolate (62% cacao)
- 10 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon sugar 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon flour
- 5 large eggs, room temp, or slightly warm for best results.
- pinch of salt & espresso
- serve with ice-cold fresh raspberry sauce
- Ingredients for about 3 Cups Fresh Raspberry Sauce
- 4 half-pint baskets of fresh raspberries (1.5 pounds), rinsed, drained
- 2 to 3 teaspoons fresh lemon juice, or to taste
- 1/4 cup sugar, or more to taste
- 4 tablespoons water, depending on desired thickness (1 TBL for this one)

directions:
- Prep 9 in pan w/ oil & flour
- Combine Butter & Chocolate in a double boiler Blend Sugar & eggs until light & airry
- add espresso & salt & flour combine 1/3 into the now cooled chocolate mixtures & then combine that back into the rest of the egg mix
- Bake at 425 F. for probably 12-15 minutes depending on the oven, until just barely set, with a jiggle below the surface. The cake will firm up as it cools.
- Depending what you're going to serve the sauce with, you may want to add some wat before cooking the berries. If you want something a little thicker, to serve over ice cream for example, then don't add any water. On the other hand, if you want and lighter texture, toss in a few tablespoons of water before heading to the stove. Be careful; we're not boiling and reducing the sauce, so we can't cook out excess liquid.
